        <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
        <strong>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable <span>content</span> of a page when looking at its layout.</strong>
        <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,<br> but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.<br> If you are going to use a passage
            of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.</p>

            <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
            <p><span>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</span></p>
